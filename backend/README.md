## How to install

### Using Git (recommended)

1.  Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nagarjunEV/gamify.git
```

### Install npm dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd gamify/backend or cd gamify/frontend
npm install
```

### Setting up environments

1.  You will find a file named `.env.example` on root directory of project.
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
3.  The file `.env` is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment. Helpful comments added to `.env.example` file to understand the constants.
